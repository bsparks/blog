I went to the <a title="jQuery" href="http://jquery.com" target="_blank">jQuery</a> <a title="Conference" href="http://events.jquery.org/2011/sf-bay-area/" target="_blank">Conference</a> in Mountain View, CA a little while ago. It was a great experience, and I think that I learned quite a bit. When I got back, I gave a short presentation at work on some of the highlights. Here are my <a title="slides" href="http://superiorcode.com/jqcon" target="_blank">slides</a> that I used for anyone who is interested. Thanks goes to <a title="Adam J Sontag" href="http://twitter.com/#!/ajpiano" target="_blank">@ajpiano</a> for the base template.
