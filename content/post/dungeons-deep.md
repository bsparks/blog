I was recently inspired to work on a "old school" dungeon crawler by a game called <a href="http://grimrock.net" target="_blank">Legend of Grimrock</a>. It's an indie game itself, inspired by Dungeon Master, which is apparently one of the more famous of the true old school games. I never played <a href="http://dmweb.free.fr/" target="_blank">Dungeon Master</a> myself when it was out originally, tho I had played other similar type games in the past like The Bard's Tale, Wasteland, <a href="http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/might_and_magic_6_limited_edition" target="_blank">Might &amp; Magic</a>, etc. Basically, these games used grid based movement to navigate a maze and fight monsters using a party of characters. I pre-ordered Grimrock and while I was waiting I installed a fan made <a title="Fan Made Clones" href="http://dmweb.free.fr/?q=view/Clones" target="_blank">clone version</a> of Dungeon Master to check it out. It did indeed seem pretty cool, even though the graphics are dated, the gameplay still seemed to hold, mouse control for clicking things for one is great. This game prolly came before The Bard's Tale and it seemed to be a bit more advanced.

Anyway, back in 2006 I had started to work on a similar game using <a href="http://www.thegamecreators.com/?m=view_product&amp;id=2030" target="_blank">Dark Basic</a>. I was taking a class in college using Dark Basic and I created a prototype in a few days. Well I had always wanted to make it something more but I never got past the prototype portion. There are some very annoying things about creating "large" programs using Dark Basic, at least at the time.

If you can tell, I do have the viewport of the dungeon rendering in 3D, but the monsters are obviously 2D images (most borrowed from the web, specifically D&amp;D).
