I got a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) kit for myself with my xmas money. It's taken me a bit of time, but I refuse to let it sit in the box like so many other
projects that I have.

<span class="pull-left img-holder large img-thumbnail">![](/images/pi/cana_kit.jpg)</span> The Raspberry Pi is just the bare board itself, normally it does
not come with any extras. This kit provides a case to mount it in, a wifi adapter (usb), and some electronics stuff (breakout board, leds, buttons). The pi
is a tiny computer. It's roughly the size of a credit card (not height) and has all of the things that you'd need to operate a computer: cpu, memory, ethernet,
video, usb, etc. It also has a GPIO (General Purpose IO) set of pins so that you can interface with the physical world. There are a multitude of
applications of this technology, from robots to retro gaming to minecraft or servers. The pi itself only costs $35 dollars, it's designed to be accessible
to as many people as possible and geared towards learning. One reason that it's called Pi is because the main programming language used to develop
for it is Python. It has an ARM processor and runs a special flavor of linux called Raspian (there are others, but this is the default).

Here I have put it inside the case, it was a little tough to snap on, but after figiting for a bit, I got it.

Next up I need to delve into the electronics side of things. Wire up some buttons and LEDs and control them via programs.
