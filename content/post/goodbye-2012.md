Well, here we are at the end of the year. I haven't made very much progress on my resolutions. Perhaps next year will be better.

In other news I somewhat recently (August) got interested in angularjs, http://angularjs.org It's a pretty awesome javascript framework for making web applications. I plan to post some tutorials and other such things soon.

The twins are 9 months old now, and I just am starting to feel like I have a little more time to work on stuff. Perhaps next year's resolutions will be achieved :D
