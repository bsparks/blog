I gave a talk today at the <a href="http://nov2011.desertcodecamp.com/" target="_blank">Desert Code Camp</a> on <a href="http://nov2011.desertcodecamp.com/session/398" target="_blank">XNA 4.0 Development Basics</a>. It was my first time presenting at any sort of event. I think overall it went pretty well, tho I had a few issues. The talk was only an hour long, and I found myself being able to cover less than I had thought. I think that in the near future I will be posting some tutorials based around this, so stay tuned.

Thanks to all those who attended, as promised here are the <a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B6DOWf9Gtu5PZmI0NjAwNjItYmYwYS00NTk3LWFlNTQtNzdkYjBmNTg1NDgx" target="_blank">materials</a> from the talk.
