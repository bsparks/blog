I've been working on this game for about a year now, and I haven't posted about it before... why? Dunno so here we go. The game is called For the Moon King. It's a top down twin stick shooter. Here is a screenshot of the almost complete main menu. The idea is that the little elf travels around to the various spots on the map for each item in the menu that is in the lake.
