Well I usually don't make New Year's resolutions. That way I don't have to deal with any of the disappointment of not following through. However, this year for some reason I'm inclined to make a few. I have been inspired and motivated to get better and smarter by stuff like this: <a href="http://david-hu.com/2012/01/05/my-experiment-in-daily-idea-generation.html" target="_blank">Idea Experiment</a> and <a href="http://developerbookclub.net/" target="_blank">Developer Book Club</a>. Not that I'm not always about learning new stuff, but I guess those sites (and others) have motivated me to post this at least and try to hold myself accountable.
<ul>
    <li>Read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882" target="_blank">Clean Code</a> - I purchased the book in Dec of 2010 according to Amazon, haven't read it yet. Just about any experienced programmer I read about tends to recommend this one.</li>
    <li>Finish <a href="http://www.facebook.com/forthemoonking" target="_blank">For the Moon King</a> in some form. Back in August I hit a brick wall pretty hard on this one. Got the game almost to the point of being ready to release on the Xbox 360, however I haven't been able to figure out some showstopping performance issues. My guess is that I'm doing something wrong :) I have a action plan for this item already, more about that later.</li>
    <li>Do a month of idea generation, similar to what is described in the blog post above.</li>
    <li>Keep posting tutorials on XNA (<a href="http://www.elderscrolls.com/skyrim/" target="_blank">Skyrim</a> is to blame for the lag on that one). "I used to write some decent tutorials for XNA, until I took an arrow in the knee."</li>
</ul>
Maybe there should be more? Dunno, I'll just edit this post and add some if I think they are needed. I had some general "ideas" but I think those are prolly gonna be best for the idea generator time.
