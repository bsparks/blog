Well, I have been interested in Voxels and Volumetric rendering for quite some time. I have also been following the game <a title="Minecraft" href="http://minecraft.net" target="_blank">Minecraft</a> for a very long time. Well, I decided to start working on my own block engine finally. It took quite a bit of research but I finally understand how it's done (well most of it). So now a couple of friends of mine and I are working on creating a version for the Xbox 360.
