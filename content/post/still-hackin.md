I'm still working on the <a href="http://dungeonhack.sourceforge.net/Main_Page" target="_blank">DungeonHack</a> project, and recently I've been given SVN commit access! Yay! This is the first open source project that I've ever officially been a part of. I've contributed several patches and actually feel like progress is being made which is always a plus. I'm glad that I've joined a team instead of trying to build a game by myself like I usually do.

Right now I'm working on integrating Paged Geometry grass into the engine instead of the current. This way we can use a color map to mask the grass off the roads.
