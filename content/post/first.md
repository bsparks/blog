Well I've been thinking about switching from Wordpress to a static site generator for some time. Now I've done it.
There are several generators out there, but I've decided to go with [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com/).
I don't really get all that much benefit from the WYSIWYG aspects of Wordpress, and it just opens up yourself to hacking and spam because of the ability to
edit online. I'm also not a huge fan of PHP, though the application has served me well enough for years I suppose.

Another reason is that it'll force me to really grok markdown. So I decided to port all (most) of my older posts over from
Wordpress. Sadly, I haven't found a faster way to do it other than manually. The good news is that I never had all that many entries :)
Oh and it helps that markdown and html are just fine together.
