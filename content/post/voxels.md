A while ago I was really looking into Voxels and Volumetric rendering. It seemed in the research I had done at the time that this was a somewhat old technology. It didnt look like anyone was still using it, even though it still seemed to me like it was a very viable solution. Anyway, now in looking at Ogre stuff I found that someone else has created a basic Voxel engine that uses Ogre to render it. <a href="http://www.thermite3d.org/joomla/" target="_blank">Thermite 3D</a> is the name of the engine, using what they call PolyVox technology. Both are available via the GPL and are open source.

They are using it for fully destructable environments, which in themselves are very cool, but what I am thinking about is using it to create volumetric cloud systems and particle effects. Oh and the other thing that I think could become of it is actually being able to make caves. Making caves using the current standard (CSG) is one of the more challenging items. I think that there are a LOT of applications for this technology, which for some reason was usually only used for medical and scientific modelling. I think that they really have the right idea using it for games and other simulations. Plus, let's mash-up I say, what can be created combining a 3D voxel world and the 3D browser web? Are those ridiculous early 90's visions of the internet going to come to life?

Here are some of the voxel engines I found in the past, most from early 2000's so that is why I thought this had died off...
